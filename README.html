<h1>advanced-text-editor</h1>

<p>a text editor made in python. Can handle multiple windows and the major mac shortcuts.
It is the advanced version of <a href="https://github.com/jLukeC/mega-project-list/blob/master/python/text-editor/basic_text_editor.py">my other editors</a></p>

<h2>Hardest parts</h2>

<p><strong>Creating live html viewer</strong> now when an html file is opened and Command+M is pressed, a window will render the html.</p>

<p><strong>Allowing multiple windows</strong> took a while especially since file commands did not work if I had trouble... (look below)</p>

<p><strong>Determining text widget in focus</strong> without this, multiple windows couldn't work nor file commands. The solution ended up being trivial but it took a while to reach, especially since root.focus_get() returns a decimal number when printed out</p>

<p><strong>Generally Keeping the Code Clean</strong> still a struggle but as I learn more about Tkinter I have made sure to make my code my straightforward and less of a mess</p>

<p>PS this readme was written using my editor</p>
